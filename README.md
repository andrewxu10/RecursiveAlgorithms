# RecursiveAlgorithms
A bunch of recursive algorithms I do for practice

Takeaways from each algorithm:

Tower of Hanoi - make sure your recursive solution is aimed at solving the simplest problem (base case). Then build out to tougher problems.

Diamter of a Tree - the simplest problem takeaway can be also used in a more broad way. I tried solving this problem by immediately attacking non-binary trees and also various weights.
It may be easier to attack a simpler version (i.e unweighted, binary tree) before going deeper.

Sum Trees -
